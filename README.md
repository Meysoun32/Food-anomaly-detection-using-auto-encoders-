# Food-anomaly-detection-using-auto-encoders-
This project uses an autoencoder to detect impurities in red chili powder images. The model reconstructs normal chili powder images and compares them to original ones, with anomalies detected using Scanner Spectral X. Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, the model effectively distinguishes pure from adulterated samples.
